# Recreation.gov-API
These (experimental) scripts were designed to use Rec gov API to collect US National Forest POI data (facilities such as campgrounds, visitor centers, etc) and create basic text descriptions of these POIs for another service (e.g. a hiking app). Played with it out of professional copywriter interest.
